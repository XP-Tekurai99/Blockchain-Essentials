# Frameworks

A blockchain development framework is a set of tools and libraries that make it easier for developers to build applications that use blockchain technology. These frameworks can provide a variety of features, such as support for specific programming languages, pre-built smart contract templates, and integration with popular blockchain networks.

Some popular blockchain development frameworks include:

## Ethereum
Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables the creation of smart contracts. It includes a programming language called Solidity, which is used to write smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Ethereum also provides a development framework called Truffle, which helps developers build, test, and deploy smart contracts and DApps.

## Hyperledger Fabric
Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source blockchain platform designed for enterprise use cases. It is modular and customizable, allowing developers to select the specific components they need for their application. Hyperledger Fabric provides a number of development tools, including the Hyperledger Composer framework, which helps developers build and deploy blockchain applications quickly.

## Corda
Corda is a distributed ledger platform that is specifically designed for financial applications. It is based on a consensus model that is optimized for high performance and privacy. Corda provides a number of development tools, including a Kotlin-based programming language called CordaScript and a development framework called CordaRPC.

## EOSIO
EOSIO is a blockchain platform that is designed for high performance and scalability. It uses a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus model and provides a number of development tools, including the EOSIO SDK for Java and the EOSIO.CDT (Contract Development Toolkit) for writing smart contracts in C++.

There are many other blockchain development frameworks available, and the best choice for a specific project will depend on the specific requirements and goals of the application being developed.
