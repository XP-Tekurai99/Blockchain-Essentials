# What is Vyper

Vyper is a programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
It was designed to be simple, expressive, and secure, with a focus on simplicity and readability.
Vyper is implemented in Python and compiles to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode, which can be executed on the Ethereum blockchain.

Vyper was created as an alternative to Solidity, the primary programming language used for Ethereum smart contracts.
It is intended to address some of the perceived issues with Solidity, such as its complexity and the potential for security vulnerabilities.

One of the main goals of Vyper is to make it easier for developers to write secure smart contracts.
To this end, Vyper has a number of features that are designed to help prevent common security vulnerabilities,
such as reentrancy attacks and integer overflow/underflow issues. It also has a strict syntax and type system, which can help prevent errors and unintended behavior.

Vyper is still a relatively new language, and it may not yet have the same level of adoption or support as other languages like Solidity. However,
it has a growing community of users and developers, and it may be a good choice for developers who are looking for a simpler and more secure alternative to Solidity.
