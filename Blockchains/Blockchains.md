### Public Blockchain
These blockchains are completely open to following the idea of decentralization. They donâ€™t have any restrictions, anyone having a computer and internet can participate in the network.

As the name is public this blockchain is open to the public, which means it is not owned by anyone. 
Anyone having internet and a computer with good hardware can participate in this public blockchain.
All the computer in the network hold the copy of other nodes or block present in the network
In this public blockchain, we can also perform verification of transactions or records.

Advantages:
* Trustable: There are algorithms to detect no fraud. Participants need not worry about the other nodes in the network
* Secure: This blockchain is large in size as it is open to the public. In a large size, there is greater distribution of records
* Anonymous Nature: It is a secure platform to make your transaction properly at the same time, you are not required to reveal your name and identity in order to participate.
* Decentralized: There is no single platform that maintains the network, instead every user has a copy of the ledger.

Disadvantages:
* Processing: The rate of the transaction process is very slow, due to its large size. Verification of each node is a very time-consuming process.
* Energy Consumption: Proof of work is high energy-consuming. It requires good computer hardware to participate in the network
* Acceptance: No central authority is there so governments are facing the issue to implement the technology faster.

Use Cases: Public Blockchain is secured with proof of work or proof of stake they can be used to displace traditional financial systems. The more advanced side of this blockchain is the smart contract that enabled this blockchain to support decentralization. Examples of public blockchain are Bitcoin, Ethereum.

### Private Blockchain
These blockchains are not as decentralized as the public blockchain only selected nodes can participate in the process, making it more secure than the others.

These are not as open as a public blockchain.
They are open to some authorized users only.
These blockchains are operated in a closed network.
In this few people are allowed to participate in a network within a company/organization.

Advantages:
* Speed: The rate of the transaction is high, due to its small size. Verification of each node is less time-consuming.
* Scalability: We can modify the scalability. The size of the network can be decided manually.
* Privacy: It has increased the level of privacy for confidentiality reasons as the businesses required.
* Balanced: It is more balanced as only some user has the access to the transaction which improves the performance of the network.

Disadvantages:
* Security: The number of nodes in this type is limited so chances of manipulation are there. These blockchains are more vulnerable.
* Centralized: Trust building is one of the main disadvantages due to its central nature. Organizations can use this for malpractices.
* Count: Since there are few nodes if nodes go offline the entire system of blockchain can be endangered.

Use Cases: With proper security and maintenance, this blockchain is a great asset to secure information without exposing it to the public eye. Therefore companies use them for internal auditing, voting, and asset management. An example of private blockchains is Hyperledger, Corda.

### Hybrid Blockchain

### Consortium Blockchain
